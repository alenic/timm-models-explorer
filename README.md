# Timm model's explorer

[**timm**](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) stands out as a wonderful Python library for Computer Vision models, boasting an extensive collection of over 500 model architectures pre-trained on Imagenet. For those delving into the world of computer vision, timm proves to be an indispensable resource.

This Streamlit application serves as a user-friendly interface for navigating the myriad models available within the timm library.
